        [[File:Atlantic Ocean - en.png|thumb|300px|The Atlantic Ocean, not including [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions]]
        {{Five oceans}}
        [[File:Atlantic Ocean to Africa.ogv|thumb|300px| This video was taken by the crew of [[Expedition 29]] on board the [[International Space Station|ISS]]. The pass starts from just northeast of the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] over the North Atlantic Ocean to [[central Africa]], over [[South Sudan]].]]
        The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the world's second largest [[ocean]]. Only the [[Pacific Ocean]] is larger. With a total [[area]] of about {{convert|106,400,000|km2|sqmi}},<ref name="brit">"The New Encyclopaedia Britannica", Volume 2, Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1974. p. 294</ref> it covers approximately 20 percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and about 29 percent of its [[water]] surface area. The first part of its name refers to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], making the Atlantic the "Sea of Atlas".
        The oldest known mention of "Atlantic" is in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): ''Atlantis thalassa'' (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: Sea of Atlas). The term Ethiopic Ocean, derived from [[Ethiopia]], was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=George Ripley|author2=Charles Anderson Dana|title=The American cyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ROQXAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA69|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=1873|publisher=Appleton|pages=69–}}</ref> Before Europeans discovered other oceans, the term "ocean" itself was synonymous with the waters beyond the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] that we now know as the Atlantic.  The early Greeks believed this ocean to be a [[Oceanus|gigantic river encircling the world]].
        The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] to the east, and the [[Americas]] to the west. As one component of the interconnected [[World Ocean|global ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to [[Antarctica]]). The [[equator]] subdivides it into the '''North Atlantic Ocean''' and '''South Atlantic Ocean'''.
        ==Geography==
        [[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|250px|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the western coast of [[Portugal]]|alt=Photo of surf breaking on rocky shore]]
        The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the [[Denmark Strait]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]]. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are [[Europe]]: the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (where it connects with the [[Mediterranean Sea]]–one of its [[marginal sea]]s–and, in turn, the [[Black Sea]], both of which also touch upon [[Asia]]) and Africa.
        In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The [[20th meridian east|20° East meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]] defines its border. Some authorities show it extending south to Antarctica, while others show it bounded at the [[60th parallel south|60° parallel]] by the Southern Ocean.<ref>[http://iodeweb5.vliz.be/oceanteacher/index.php?module=contextview&action=contextdownload&id=gen11Srv32Nme37_366 ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'']. International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.</ref>
        In the southwest, the [[Drake Passage]] connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The [[wikt:man-made|man-made]] [[Panama Canal]] links the Atlantic and Pacific. Besides those mentioned, other large bodies of water adjacent to the Atlantic are the [[Caribbean Sea]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Hudson Bay]], the Arctic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]], and the [[Celtic Sea]].
        Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic is second in size to the Pacific. With its adjacent seas, it occupies an area of about {{convert|106400000|km2|sqmi}};<ref name="brit" /> without them, it has an area of {{convert|82400000|km2|sqmi}}. The land that drains into the Atlantic covers four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000&nbsp;cubic kilometers (85,100,000&nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000&nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&nbsp;cu mi).
        The average depth of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas, is {{convert|3339|m|fathom ft|lk=out}}; without them it is {{convert|3926|m|fathom ft}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The greatest depth, [[Milwaukee Deep]] with {{convert|8380|m|fathom ft}}, is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]. The Atlantic's width varies from {{convert|1538|nmi|km mi|lk=in}} between [[Brazil]] and [[Sierra Leone]] to over {{convert|3450|nmi|km mi|-2}} in the south.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
        ==Cultural significance==
        [[Transatlantic crossing|Transatlantic travel]] played a major role in the expansion of Western civilization into the Americas. It is the Atlantic that separates the "[[Old World]]" from the "[[New World]]". In [[modern history|modern times]], some [[idiom]]s refer to the ocean in a humorously diminutive way as '''the Pond''', describing both the geographical and cultural divide between North America and Europe, in particular between the English-speaking nations of both continents. Many British people refer to the United States and Canada as "across the pond", and vice versa.<ref>Example: BBC Click – Episode 4 April 2009</ref>
        The "Black Atlantic" refers to the role of this ocean in shaping black people's history, not least in diasporas. Irish migration to the US is meant when the term "The Green Atlantic" is used. The "Red Atlantic" is a relatively new term that refers to seafarers as proletarians and revolutionaries who historically resisted exploitation at sea and forged a new multicultural and polyglot Atlantic working-class.

        ==Ocean floor==
        [[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|thumb|Atlantic [[bathymetry]]|Map that uses color to show ocean depth]]
        The principal feature of the [[bathymetry]] (bottom [[topography]]) is a [[Mid-ocean ridge|submarine mountain range]] called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Challenger at Sea: A Ship That Revolutionized Earth Science| year = 1992| isbn = 978-0-691-08735-1| page = 57 }}</ref> It extends from [[Iceland]] in the north to approximately [[58th parallel south|58° South latitude]], reaching a maximum width of about {{convert|860|nmi|km mi|-1}}. A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than {{convert|2700|m|fathom ft}} in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep. Several peaks rise above the water and form islands.<ref>{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Mediterranean Was a Desert: A Voyage of the Glomar Challenger| year = 1987| isbn = 978-0-691-02406-6 }}</ref> The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the [[Walvis Ridge]].<ref>National Geographic Atlas of the World: Revised Sixth Edition, National Geographic Society, 1992</ref>
        The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|troughs]] with depths from {{convert|3700|-|5500|m|fathom ft}}. Tr
        ansverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the [[Blake Basin|Blake]], Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.
        The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, [[abyssal plains]], [[oceanic trench|trenches]], [[seamount]]s, [[Oceanic basin|basins]], [[Oceanic plateau|plateaus]], [[Submarine canyon|canyons]], and some [[guyot]]s. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.
        Ocean floor trenches and seamounts:
        * [[Puerto Rico Trench]], in the North Atlantic, is the deepest trench at {{convert|8605|m|fathom ft}}<ref>[http://www.sea-seek.com/site/Milwaukee_Deep Milwaukee Deep]. sea-seek.com</ref>
        * [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of [[Canada]]
        * [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of {{convert|8428|m|fathom ft}}
        * [[Romanche Trench]] is located near the [[equator]] and reaches a depth of about {{convert|7454|m|fathom ft}}.
        Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of:
        * [[Terrigenous]] deposits with land origins, consisting of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by [[erosion]], [[weathering]], and volcanic activity on land washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest near large river mouths or off desert coasts.
        * [[Pelagic]] deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from {{convert|60|-|3300|m|fathom ft}} they are thickest in the convergence belts, notably at the [[Hamilton Ridge]] and in upwelling zones.
        * [[Authigenic]] deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits, such as in the [[Hewett Curve]].
        ==Water characteristics==
        [[File:Circulacion termohalina.jpg|Path of the [[thermohaline circulation]]. Purple paths represent deep-water currents, while blue paths represent surface currents.|thumb|alt=Map displaying a looping line with arrows indicating that water flows eastward in the far Southern ocean, angling north east of Australia, turning sough after passing Alaska, then crossing the mid-Pacific to flow north of Australia, continuing west below Africa, then turning northwest until reaching eastern Canada, then angling east to southern Europe, then finally turning south just below Greenland and flowing down the Americas' eastern coast, and resuming its flow eastward to complete the circle]]
        [[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major ocean [[Ocean gyre|gyres]]|alt=Map showing 5 circles. The first is between western Australia and eastern Africa. The second is between eastern Australia and western South America. The third is between Japan and western North America. Of the two in the Atlantic, one is in hemisphere.]]
        On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water [[salinity]] in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and [[sea ice]] melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about [[25th parallel north|25° north]] and [[25th parallel south|south]], in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.
        Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below {{convert|−2|C|F}}. Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7–8 °C (12–15°F).
        The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters make up the surface. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of {{convert|1000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] reaches depths of as much as {{convert|4000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres.
        Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate the [[Sargasso Sea]], a large elongated body of water, with above average salinity. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]] and is also the spawning ground for both the [[European eel]] and the [[American eel]].
        The [[Coriolis effect]] circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above [[40th parallel north|40° North]] some east-west oscillation occurs.
        ==Climate==
        [[File:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|right|Waves in the [[trade wind]]s in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.|alt=Map of Caribbean showing seven approximately parallel westward-pointing arrows that extend from east of the Virgin Islands to Cuba. The southern arrows bend northward just east of the Dominican Republic before straightening out again.]]
        Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.
        The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.
        The [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe and influences weather and climate as far south as the northern Mediterranean. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] area) and Africa's north-western coast. In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.  More  local   particular weather examples could be found in examples such as the; [[Azores High]], [[Benguela Current]], [[Nor'easter]].
        {{Clear}}
        ==History==
        [[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Animation showing the separation of [[Pangaea]], which formed the Atlantic Ocean known today|alt=Animation showing the continents separating from a single mass, making creating the Atlantic in the process]]
        The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the five oceans. It did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent [[Pangaea]] were drifting apart.{{cn|date=January 2014}} The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements along its shores.
        The [[Viking]]s, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and the Spaniards were the most famous among early explorers. After Columbus, European explorat
        ion rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.
        As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the [[Americas]] (known as transatlantic trade). Scientific explorations include the [[Challenger expedition]], the [[German Meteor expedition]], [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and the [[United States Navy Hydrographic Office]].
        ===Notable crossings===
        [[File:RaII.InMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ra II]], a ship built from [[papyrus]], was successfully sailed across the Atlantic by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] proving that it was possible to cross the Atlantic from Africa using such boats in early epochs of history.]]
        * Around 980 – 982, [[Erik the Red]] discovered [[Greenland]], geographically and geologically a part of the Americas.
        * In the year 1000, the Icelander [[Leif Ericson]] was the first European to set foot on North American soil, corresponding to today's Eastern coast of Canada, i. e. the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], including the area of land named "[[Vinland]]" by Ericson. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] discovery was documented in the 13th century [[Icelandic Sagas]] and was corroborated by recent [[L'Anse aux Meadows|L'Anse aux Meadows archeological evidence]].
        * Around 1010, [[Thorfinn Karlsefni|Thorfinnr Karlsefni]] led an attempted [[Viking]] settlement in North America with 160 settlers, but was later driven off by the natives. His son [[Snorri Thorfinnsson]] was the first American born (somewhere between 1010 and 1013) to European (Icelandic) immigrant parents.
        * In 1419 and 1427, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese navigators]] reached [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]], respectively.
        * From 1415 to 1488, Portuguese navigators sailed along the Western African coast, reaching the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

        * In April 1563, Nicolas Barre and 20 other stranded Huguenots were the first to build a (crude) boat in the Americas and sail across the Atlantic. They sailed from Charlesfort, South Carolina to just off the coast of England where they were rescued by an English ship. Though they resorted to cannibalism, seven men survived the voyage, including Barre.<ref>http://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/the-huguenot-settlement-in-16th-century-south-carolina</ref><ref>http://www.jcs-group.com/oldwest/america/1562ribaut.html</ref>
        * In 1764, William Harrison (the son of [[John Harrison]]) sailed aboard the [[HMS Tartar (1756)|HMS Tartar]], with the [[Harrison Number Four|H-4]] time piece. The voyage became the basis for the invention of the global system of [[Longitude]].
        * In 1858, [[Cyrus West Field]] laid the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] (it quickly failed).
        * In 1865, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]]'s ship the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']] laid the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable.
        * In 1870, the small [[City of Ragusa]] ([[Dubrovnik]]) became the first small [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|Lifeboat]] to cross the Atlantic from [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to [[Boston]] with two men crew, John Charles Buckley and Nikola Primorac (di Costa), only.<ref>{{cite book| author = William H.

Associated Press. 16 October 2008</ref>
        * 1914–1918, the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]] took place.
        * In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[seaplane]] to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands and the sea along the way, and taxied several hundred miles).
        * Later in 1919, a British [[aeroplane]] piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]].
        * In 1921, the British were the first to cross the North Atlantic in an [[airship]].
        * In 1922, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] aviators [[Artur de Sacadura Cabral|Sacadura Cabral]] and [[Gago Coutinho]] were the [[First aerial crossing of the South Atlantic]] on a seaplane connecting [[Lisbon]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]].
        * In 1927, [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an aircraft (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]).
        * In 1931, [[Bert Hinkler]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight across the South Atlantic in an aircraft.
        * In 1932, [[Amelia Earhart]] became the first female to make a solo flight across the Atlantic
        * 1939–1945, the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic]]. Nearly 3,700 Allied ships were sunk at a cost of 783 German [[U-boat]]s.<ref>"Introduction" ''U-Boat Operations of the Second World War—Vol 1'' by Wynn, Kenneth, 1998 p. 1</ref>
        * In 1952, [[Ann Davison]] was the first woman to single-handedly [[sail]] the Atlantic Ocean.
        * In 1965, [[Robert Manry]] crossed the Atlantic from the U.S. to England non-stop in a 13.5 foot (4.05 meters) sailboat named "Tinkerbell".<ref>Tinkerbelle (1967; Harper & Row, New York City, N.Y.)</ref> Several others also crossed the Atlantic in very small sailboats in the 1960s, none of them non-stop, though.
        * In 1969 and 1970 [[Thor Heyerdahl]] launched expeditions to cross the Atlantic in boats built from [[papyrus]]. He succeeded in crossing the Atlantic from [[Morocco]] to [[Barbados]] after a two-month voyage of 6,100&nbsp;km with [[Ra II]] in 1970, thus conclusively proving that boats such as the Ra could have sailed with the [[Canary Current]] across the Atlantic in prehistoric times.<ref>Ryne, Linn.

        * In 1994, [[Guy Delage]] was the first man to allegedly swim across the Atlantic Ocean (with the help of a kick board, from [[Cape Verde]] to [[Barbados]]).
        * In 1998, [[Benoît Lecomte]] was the first man to swim across the northern Atlantic Ocean without a kick board, stopping for only one week in the [[Azores]].
        * In 1999, after rowing for 81 days and 4,767 kilometres (2,962&nbsp;mi), [[Tori Murden]] became the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by [[rowboat]] alone when she reached [[Guadeloupe]] from the [[Canary Islands]].
        ==Ethiopic Ocean==
        The '''[[Aethiopian Sea]]''', '''Ethiopic Ocean''' or '''Ethiopian Ocean''' (Okeanos Aithiopos), is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean, which is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow
         region between [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal, Brazil]] and [[Monrovia, Liberia]].  The use of this term illustrates a past trend towards referring to the whole continent of [[Africa]] by the name ''[[Name of Ethiopia|Aethiopia]]''.  The modern nation of Ethiopia, in northeast Africa, is nowhere near the Ethiopic Ocean, which would be said to lie off the west coast of Africa. The term Ethiopian Ocean sometimes appeared until the mid-19th century, as e.g. on the map ''The Dutch colony of the Cape of Good Hope by L.S. de la Rochette, MDCCXCV", published by W. Faden in London in 1795.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
        ==Economy==
        The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant [[petroleum]] deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves. The Atlantic hosts the world's richest [[fishing]] resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major fish are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]].
        The most productive areas include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]'s [[Grand Banks]], the [[Nova Scotia]] shelf, [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the [[Bahama Banks]], the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s appear in great quantities. Various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the [[incineration]] of toxic wastes at sea. <!-- This would be good if it were in an infobox

        Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the Caribbean Sea or up the east coast of [[North America]]; hurricanes can occur from May to December but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.
        -->
        ==Terrain==
        From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and Baltic Sea. A clockwise warm-water [[gyre]] occupies the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre appears in the southern Atlantic. The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]] dominates the ocean floor. This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the ocean floor and the islands rising from it.
        The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Norwegian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Gulf of Maine]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Caribbean Sea]].
        [[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|Islands]] include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (including hundreds of surrounding islands), [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Great Britain]] (including numerous surrounding islands), [[Ireland]], [[Rockall]], [[Sable Island]], [[Azores]], [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Madeira]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Caribbean]], [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Annobón Province]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Gough Island]] (Also known as Diego Alvarez), [[Falkland Islands]], [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[South Georgia Island]], [[South Sandwich Islands]], and [[Bouvet Island]].
        ===Natural resources===
        The Atlantic harbors [[petroleum]] and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], [[marine mammal]]s ([[Pinniped|seals]] and whales), [[sand]] and [[gravel]] aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, [[polymetallic nodules]], and precious stones.
        ===Natural hazards===
        [[File:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg with surrounding clouds|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg]]
        [[Iceberg]]s are common from February to August in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and [[Madeira]]. Ships are subject to [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in the extreme north from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).
        The United States' southeast coast has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs. The Virginia and North Carolina coasts were particularly dangerous.
        The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but [[Coast Guard]] records do not support this belief.
        [[Hurricanes]] are also a natural hazard in the Atlantic, but mainly in the northern part of the ocean, rarely [[tropical cyclones]] form in the southern parts. Hurricanes usually form between 1 June and 30 November of every year.
        ==Current environmental issues==
        Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. [[Drift net]] fishing can kill [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes.<ref>[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arus12bcenvtlafflrev473.htm Problems and Prospects for the Pelagic Driftnet]. animallaw.info. Retrieved on 27 October 2011.</ref> Municipal pollution comes from the eastern [[United States]], southern [[Brazil]], and eastern [[Argentina]]; [[oil pollution]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]]; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.
        In 2005, there was some concern that warm northern European currents were slowing down.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5033329 Atlantic Ocean's 'Heat Engine' Chills Down] by Christopher Joyce. All Things Considered, National Public Radio, 30 November 2005.</ref>
        On 7 June 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.
        ===Marine pollution===
        {{Main|Marine pollution}}
        {{See also|Ship pollution}}
        Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture [[fertilizer]] chemicals as well as [[livestock]] and [[human]] waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].<ref>Sebastian A. Gerlach "Marine Pollution", Springer, Berlin (1975)</ref>
        [[Marine debris]], which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[Oceanic gyres|gyres]] and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

        '''Aruba''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|uː|b|ə}} {{respell|ə|ROO|bə}}; {{IPA-nl|aˈruba}}) is an island 33 kilometre long (20&nbsp;mi) located about {{convert|1600|km}} west of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]], located {{convert|27|km|0}} north of the coast of [[Venezuela]]. Together with [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], it forms a group referred to as the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Collectively, Aruba and the other [[Dutch Caribbean|Dutch islands in the Caribbean]] are often called the [[Netherlands Antilles]] or the Dutch Antilles.
        Aruba is one of the four [[Constituent country|constituent countries]] that form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], along with the [[Netherlands]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions. Its capital is [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].
        Unlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, [[cactus]]-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. It has a land area of {{convert|179|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is densely populated, with a total of 101,484 inhabitants at the 2010 Census. It lies outside the [[hurricane belt]].
        == History ==
        {{main|History of Aruba}}
        Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to have been [[Caquetios Indian|Caquetíos Amerinds]] from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] tribe, who migrated there from [[Venezuela]] to escape attacks by the [[Caribs]]. Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. As sea currents made [[canoe]] travel to other [[Caribbean islands]] difficult, [[Caquetio]] culture remained more closely associated with that of mainland South America.
        [[File:Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.30|The capital [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]]]
        Europeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations for Spain by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in the summer of 1499. Though Vespucci boasted of discovering the island, Ojeda was likely first, learning of it from natives of nearby islands.{{cn|date=September 2013}} Both described Aruba as an "island of giants", remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos compared to Europeans. Ojeda also referred to the island as ''Oro Hubo,'' Spanish for "It had gold". Gold was not discovered on Aruba, however, for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]] from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and Spaniards soon colonized the island.<ref name=advent>{{cite book |last=Sullivan| first=Lynne M.| year=2006| title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire & Curacao| publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc.| location=Edison, NJ| pages=57–58| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC&lpg=PA58}}</ref><ref name=early>{{cite book | last=Sauer| first=Carl Ortwin| year=1966| title=The Early Spanish Main| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| page=112| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=plzS7SL_-f0C&lpg=PA112}}</ref>
        Because it had low rainfall, Aruba was not considered profitable for the plantation system and the economics of the [[slave trade]].{{cn|date=July 2013}}
        Aruba was colonized by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] for over a century. ''Simas,'' the ''[[Cacique]]'' or [[Tribal chief|chief]] in Aruba, welcomed the first Catholic priests in Aruba, who gave him a wooden cross as a gift. In 1508, the Spanish Crown appointed Alonso de Ojeda as its first Governor of Aruba, as part of ''Nueva Andalucía.''
        Arawaks spoke the "broken Spanish" which their ancestors had learned on Hispaniola.{{cn|date=July 2013}}
        Another governor appointed by Spain was [[Juan Martínez de Ampiés]]. A ''cédula real'' decreed in November 1525 gave Ampíes, factor of Española, the right to repopulate Aruba. In 1528, Ampíes was replaced by a representative of the [[Welser|House of Welser]].
        The Netherlands have covered the island with their regulations since 1629. Since 1636, Aruba has been under [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] administration, initially governed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]], later appointed to [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City). Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. The island was included under the Dutch [[Dutch West India Company]] (W.I.C.) administration, as "New Netherland and Curaçao," from 1648 to 1664. In 1667 the Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as "Commandeur" in Aruba.
        The Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean.{{citation needed|reason=no direct linkage has been supplied to demonstrate that one lead to the other|date=August 2012}}
        In August 1806, General [[Francisco de Miranda]] and a group of 200 freedom fighters, traveling to liberate Venezuela from Spain, stayed in Aruba for several weeks.{{cn|date=July 2013}}
        In 1933, Aruba sent its first petition to the Queen seeking independent status and autonomy.{{cn|date=July 2013}}
        During [[World War II]], Aruba was one of the main suppliers of refined petroleum products to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. During the war, after the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]], Aruba was made a British [[protectorate]] from 1940 to 1942, and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945.
        On 16 February 1942, a German submarine (''[[German submarine U-156 (1941)|U-156]]'') under the c
        ommand of Werner Hartenstein attacked the island's oil processing refinery, but the mission failed.
        In March 1944, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the [[First Lady of the United States]], briefly visited American troops stationed in Aruba. In attendance were Curaçao Governor P. Kasteel, and U.S. Rear Admiral [[Theodore E. Chandler|T. E. Chandler]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
        === Move towards independence ===
        In August 1947, Aruba presented its first ''Staatsreglement'' (constitution), for Aruba's ''status aparte'' as an autonomous state within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. By 1954, the Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robbers|first=Gerhard|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|volume=1|year=2007|location=New York City|page=649|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&lpg=PA649|isbn=0-8160-6078-9}}</ref>
        In 1972, at a conference in [[Suriname]], [[Betico Croes]] (MEP), a politician from Aruba, proposed a ''sui-generis'' Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], each to have its own nationality. C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a [[referendum]] so that the people of Aruba could choose whether they wanted total independence or ''Status Aparte'' as a full autonomous state under the Crown.
        Croes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, he appointed a committee that chose the national flag and anthem, introducing them as symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence. He set 1981 as a target date for independence. In March 1977, the first Referendum for Self Determination was held with the support of the United Nations; 82% of the participants voted for independence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
        The Island Government of Aruba assigned the Institute of Social Studies in [[The Hague]] to prepare a study for independence; it was titled ''Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg'' (Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities and opportunities; a preliminary report) (1978). At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.
        In March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy. In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles; it officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was projected in 1996.
        After his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed ''Libertador di Aruba''. At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's [[Nelson Oduber|Prime Minister]], the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely its transition to full independence. The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.
        == Geography ==
        [[File:Aruba map.png|thumb|upright=1.70|A map of Aruba]]
        {{main|Geography of Aruba}}
        Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the [[Leeward Antilles]] island arc of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern part of the Caribbean. It has white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island, relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents.{{cn|date=July 2013}} This is where most tourist development has occurred.{{cn|date=July 2013}} The northern and eastern coasts, lacking this protection, are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans.
        The hinterland of the island features some rolling hills, the best known of which are called [[Hooiberg]] at {{convert|165|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and [[Mount Jamanota]], the highest on the island at {{convert|188|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{Coord|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.
        To the east of Aruba are [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. This group of islands is sometimes called the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]].
        The [[Aruba Natural Bridge|Natural Bridge]] was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore. It was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.

        == Demographics ==
        {{Main|Demographics of Aruba}}
        [[File:Aruba-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.60|Population of Aruba 1961–2003, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in 2005; number of inhabitants given in thousands.]]
        The population is estimated to be 80% mixed Black/White/Caribbean Amerindian and 20% other ethnicities.
        The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. Although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage. Most of the population is descended mostly from Arawak, and to a lesser extent Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and a few French, Portuguese, British, and African ancestors.
        Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of three years residency on the island.
        Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.
        === Language ===
        {{main|Languages of Aruba}}
        Language can be seen as an important part of island culture in Aruba. The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and – since 2003 – [[Papiamento]]. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. A [[creole language]] spoken on Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], it incorporates words from other languages including Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken based on the size of their community are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.
        In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. "y" instead of "j"), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.
        The book ''The Buccaneers of America'', first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the Indians on Aruba spoke "Spanish". The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.<ref name=cia>{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=2011-06-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
        Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: ''Diario'', ''Bon Dia'', ''Solo di Pueblo'' and ''Awe Mainta''; and two in English: ''Aruba Today'' and ''The News''. ''Amigoe'' is the newspaper published in Dutch. Aruba also has 18 radio stations (two AM and 16 FM) and three local television stations (Tele-Aruba, Aruba Broadcast Company and Channel 22).
        === Regions ===
        For census purposes, Aruba is divided into eight regions, which have no administrative functions:

        [[File:Parlamento di Aruba (front).jpg|thumb|Parliament of Aruba in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].]]
        As a [[constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Aruba's politics take place within a framework of a 21-member [[parliamentary democracy|Parliament]] and an eight-member Cabinet. The [[governor of Aruba]] is appointed for a six-year term by the monarch, and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are elected by the Staten (or "Parlamento") for four-year terms. The Staten is made up of 21 members elected by direct, popular vote to serve a four-year term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arubaforeignaffairs.com/afa/readBlob.do?id=694|title=Political Stability|accessdate=2011-06-07 |work= |publisher=Aruba Department of Foreign Affairs|date= }}</ref>
        Together with the [[Netherlands]], the countries of Aruba, [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. As they share the same Dutch citizenship, these four countries still also share the Dutch passport as the Kingdom of the Netherlands passport. As Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have small populations, the three countries had to limit immigration. To protect their population, they have the right to control the admission and expulsion of people from the Netherlands.
        Aruba is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the [[European Union]], though Aruba can and does receive support from the European Development Fund.<ref name=euprofile>{{cite web |url=http://www.eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm |title=EU Relations with Aruba |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110609050531/http://eeas.europa.eu/aruba/index_en.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/index_en.htm |title=Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) |accessdate=2011-06-06 |work= |publisher=European Union |date= }}</ref>
        === Politics ===
        The Aruban legal system is based on the Dutch model. Instead of juries or grand juries, in Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the ''Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg'' ([[Court of First Instance]]) on Aruba, the ''Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba'' ([[Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba]]) and the ''[[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden]]'' (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).<ref>[http://www.aruba.co
        m/ExploretheIsland/IslandFacts/law.aspx Aruba.com]</ref> The ''Korps Politie Aruba'' ([[Aruba Police Force]]) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.<ref name="KPA-districts">{{cite web|url=http://www.kparuba.com/districts.html|title=Korps Politie Aruba: district precincts|publisher=Aruba Police Force|accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>
        [[Deficit spending]] has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. As of 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.<ref>{{cite web |author=Central Bureau of Statistics|title=Key Indicators General Government, 1997–2006|url=http://www.cbs.aw/cbs/manageDocument.do?dispatch=view&id=927|accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref> Aruba received some [[development aid]] from the Dutch government each year through 2009, as part of a deal (signed as "Aruba's Financial Independence") in which the Netherlands gradually reduced its financial help to the island each successive year.
        In 2006, the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit. [[Direct tax]]es have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. A 3% tax has been introduced on sales and services, while income taxes have been lowered and revenue taxes for business reduced by 20%. The government compensated workers with 3.1% for the effect that the B.B.O. would have on the inflation for 2007.
        == Education ==
        Aruba's educational system is patterned after the [[Education in the Netherlands|Dutch system of education]].{{cn|date=September 2013}}
        The Government of Aruba finances the national education system. Private schools, such as the International School of Aruba (ISA), finance their own activities. The percentage of money earmarked for education is higher than the average for the Caribbean/Latin American region.{{cn|date=September 2013}}
        Arubans have a primary school system, followed by a segmented secondary school program which includes vocational training, basic education, college preparation and advanced placement.{{cn|date=September 2013}}
        The study of Spanish, English, Dutch and French is offered in secondary school and college, since a high percentage of students continue their studies in Europe.{{cn|date=September 2013}}
        Higher education is available through the Professional Education program (EPI), the teachers college (IPA) as well as through the University of Aruba (UA) which offers bachelors and masters programs in law, finance and economics and hospitality and tourism management. Since the choice for higher education on the island itself is limited, many students choose study in the Netherlands, or abroad in countries in North America, South America as well as the rest of Europe.{{cn|date=September 2013}}
        Aruba is also home to two [[medical schools]]: [[Aureus University School of Medicine]] and [[Xavier University School of Medicine]].
        == Economy ==
        {{Main|Economy of Aruba}}
        Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region. There is a low unemployment rate.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
        The GDP per capita for Aruba was estimated to be $21,800 in 2004; among the highest in the Caribbean and the Americas.<ref name="cia" /> Its main trading partners are [[Venezuela]], the United States and the [[Netherlands]].
        [[File:Aruba export map.png|thumb|upright=1.70|A graphical breakdown of Aruba's economy by exports]]
        The island's economy has been dominated by five main industries: tourism, [[gold mining]], [[phosphate]] mining (The Aruba Phosphaat Maatschappij), [[aloe]] export, and [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]] (The Lago Oil and Transport Company and the Arend Petroleum Maatschappij Shell Co.).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Before the "Status Aparte" (a separate completely autonomous country/state within the Kingdom), oil processing was the dominant industry in Aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector. Today, the influence of the oil processing business is minimal. The size of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors also remains minimal.
        The inflation on Aruba in 2007 was 8.7%.
        The official exchange rate of the [[Aruban florin]] is pegged to the US dollar at 1.79 florins to 1 USD.<ref>[http://www.currency.me.uk/convert/usd/awg]</ref><ref>[http://themoneyconverter.com/USD/AWG.aspx]</ref><!---note that currency fluctuates slightly because of the necessity of forcing the florin to the dollar by buying or selling florins or dollars---> Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel and resort districts.
        ===Tourism===
        About three quarters of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through tourism or related activities.{{cn|date=October 2013}} Most tourists are from the United States (predominantly from the north-east US), the Netherlands and South-America, mainly Venezuela and Colombia.{{cn|date=October 2013}}
        As part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, citizens of (mainland) the Netherlands can travel with relative ease to Aruba and other islands of the Dutch Antilles. No visas are needed for Dutch citizens, only a passport, and although the currency used in Aruba is different (the Netherlands has the Euro), Euros are still not widely accepted but can be  easily exchanged at a local bank for Aruban Florins.
        For the facilitation of the passengers whose destination is the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) full pre-clearance facility in Aruba has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion in the Queen Beatrix Airport. United States and Aruba have had the agreement since 1986. It began as a USDA and Customs post. Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
        ===Military===
        In 1999, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] established a [[Forward Operating Site|Forward Operating Location]] (FOL) at the airport.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}.
        There is also a small Dutch marines base by Savaneta containing approximately 200 Dutch Marines and about 100 AruMil forces.{{cn|date=October 2013}}
        == Culture ==
        {{Main|Culture of Aruba}}
        {{See also|Music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles}}
        [[File:Centrum Oranjestad.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.30|Ornate buildings in [[Oranjestad, Aruba]].]]
        On 18 March, Aruba celebrates its National Day. In 1976, Aruba presented its National Anthem (Aruba Dushi Tera) and Flag.
        Aruba has a varied culture. According to the ''Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister'' (BBSB), as of 2005 there are ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of "[[Sinterklaas]]" on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 30 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the Queen's birthday or "Dia di La Reina" ([[Koninginnedag]]) is celebrated.
        [[File:Iguanas Aruba.JPG|left|thumb|[[Iguana]]s on a rooftop in Aruba.]]
        Christmas and [[New Years Eve]] are celebrated with the typical music and songs for [[Gaita flutes|gaita]]s for Christmas and the Dande{{clarify|date=November 2012}} for New Year, and the "[[Hallaca|ayaca]]", "[[ponche crema]]," ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of florins worth of [[fireworks]] are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve. On 25 January, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated. [[St John's Eve|Dia di San Juan]] is celebrated on June 24.
        Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Good Friday]] are holidays on the island.
        The holiday of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like [[Mardi Gras]], that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from the nearby islands (Venezuela, St Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for
        the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).
        Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving Day in November.
        == Infrastructure ==
        Aruba's [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] is located near Oranjestad. According to the Aruba Airport Authority, almost 1.7 million travelers used the airport in 2005, 61% of whom were Americans.
        Aruba has two ports, Barcadera and Playa, which are located in Oranjestad. The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]], [[Holland America Line]], [[Disney Cruise Line]] and others. Nearly one million tourists enter this port per year. Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government, runs these seaports.
        Arubus is a government-owned bus company. Its buses operate from 3:30&nbsp;am until 12:30&nbsp;am 365 days a year. Small private vans also provide transportation services in certain areas such Hotel Area, San Nicolaas, Santa Cruz and Noord.
